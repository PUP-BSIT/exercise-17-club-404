-> Missing 'C' in "ollaboration".

This line of code can be refactored, instead of this, initialize the 6 to the 
constant EXIT_OPTION variable. (EXIT_OPTION = 6). Therefore the while loop is more readable.

-> while user_input != EXIT_OPTION;

Console Error: ValueError

-> The codes can be improved by implementing error handling. After inputting a 
letter as my choice to menu, the console returns a "ValueError" which can be catched.

-> The codes are working, there are some line of code that needs changes and 
misspellings that needs to be corrected.
