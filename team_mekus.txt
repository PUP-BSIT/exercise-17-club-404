Serohijos's module is not working at main.py when selecting "5"

If the entry point of your game is the main() method, then in main.py, replace:
https://github.com/PUP-BSIT/exercise-15-mekus/blob/b8b1e7000fe41f81d97c2cfbc66b790edfcd5fc3/main.py#L60

to RockPaperScissors().main()

Suggestion:
- Use 2 spaces for indentation consistently throughout the code.
Follow the Coding Guideline: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IpJfVIL8W1JWptSXPOAlSx2S1hHtdEoIbl7fGoyrWqU/edit?slide=id.g30ae8cef28b_0_176#slide=id.g30ae8cef28b_0_176

- Using brief one-liner docstrings can be improved by clear inputs/outputs and behavior if used by others.
